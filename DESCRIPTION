Description: A collection of useful functions that I have used in various 
  projects and in other R packages. Support some miscellaneous operations on 
  data frames and vectors, pretty printing of vector values and names in an R
  notebook, quick saving of a matrix to file, making a multiple densities plot,
  etc.
