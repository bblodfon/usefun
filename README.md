A collection of useful functions that I have used in various projects and in 
other R packages. They support some miscellaneous operations on lists, data frames, 
matrices and vectors, pretty printing of vector names and values in an R 
notebook, quick saving of data to a file, making a multiple densities plot, 
etc.

## Install

```
devtools::install_github("bblodfon/usefun")
```
## Examples

Most of the functions from this package have examples in the documentation
and have been used in this [biomarker analysis](https://bblodfon.github.io/gitsbe-model-analysis/atopo/cell-lines-2500/),
which also acts as a vignette for this package.
