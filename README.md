A set of miscellaneous functions that I have used in various projects and in other R packages. 
Some of the most important are:

- `get_roc_stats()`: the ROC statistics the way you want it!
- `pr.test()`: test two PR curves (AUCs) and get a p-value!
- `partial_permut()`: get a partially-scrambled vector (you choose how much!)
- `normalize_to_range()`: normalize a vector to a specified range
- `dec_to_bin()`: convert a decimal (base-10) number to its binary representation
- `get_percentage_of_matches()`: find the percentage of common elements between two vectors
- `outersect()`: find the non-common elements between two vectors (outer-section!)
- `colors.100`: a vector of 100 as much as possible *distinct* colors
